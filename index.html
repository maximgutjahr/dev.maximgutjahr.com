            <p id="album-concept-content">
                Ridden with stigmatized and not understood mental illness, you, in an attempt to gain any positive emotion out of his live draw a drastic and last measure, the only one you see left- you leave earth, your „home“ as they call it, but that isn’t what earth ever felt like to you.<br/>
                The people at home aren’t supposed to judge you, push you aside, and laugh at you, are they? But that is all you have known from humanity. You now float through space, alone, for the rest of your live, exploring the universe, wandering from planet to planet to experience the beauty you couldn't find at your old place.<br/> 
                Now the stars are your home.<br/><br/>

                With this album I explore what variation of feelings one must experience in that situation, letting go of all the people that have mistreated you for so long, finding peace in loneliness and I will also talk about how stigmatized mental illness still is.<br/>
                Because while I think many would wish to leave earth as I describe on my album, far too many leave this life fully, and I think if we can spread understanding instead of judgement, that will change.<br/><br/>

                Music, lyrics and concept are all written by me. I will also direct all visual elements, but they will be brought to life by my wonderful friends. Yes, even I have my limits.
